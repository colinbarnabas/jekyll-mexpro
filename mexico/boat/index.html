                    <p>Liability and legal coverage in Mexico has become significantly more important with recent changes in the law. Mexican boat liability is as important as Mexico car liability insurance. In many cases it is required at the marinas, before you are able to launch a boat.</p>
                    <p>Our policy is limited to the required coverage of liability and legal coverage, and does not extend any hull coverage or coverage for passengers of the watercraft. That said, if you need coverage you can quickly and easily purchase it online in less than five minutes and print the policy required to enter the marina or operate in Mexican waters.</p>
