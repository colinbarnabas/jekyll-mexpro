When our optional MexVisit&reg; Travel Assistance coverage is purchased, in addition to the regular tourist auto insurance policy, coverage includes not only excellent auto insurance protection from Mexico's finest underwriters, but also the best travel assistance coverage available in the marketplace.

                        <p><strong>Read this Testimonial from One of our Satisfied MexVisit&reg; Customers...</strong></p>
                        <p>&quot;I just wanted to drop you a line to say thank-you.  We purchased insurance from you for a recent Mexico trip, and included the Mex-Visit travel assist. When our car broke down on Highway 57 south, about 50km north of San Luis Potosi, I called the 800 number and was assisted by a very helpful English speaking representative named Eduardo Martinez. Eduardo called a tow truck for us, re-assured us that we were being helped, and gave me his return extension so that we could contact him if we needed to. The tow-truck came in about an hour, and the driver took us to a great mechanic who fixed the problem immediately, at a very reasonable price.  Less than four hours after breaking down, we were back on the road and continued safely to our destination. I don't know what we would have done without your assistance. Thank-you, and please forward my thanks to Eduardo. He took care of everything in a calm, professional manner and was very reassuring at a time when I was nervous about being stranded. <br>Thanks, Betsy"</p>
