The Mexico Free Zone, also known as the the Liberated Zone, or Perimeter Zone or Free Trade Zone is a customs designation only for that area located along the Mexican international land borders and which run inward up to the point at which the Mexican Customs authorities have their first &quot;interior&quot; check point (this is usually about 20 to 26 kilometers in from the border towns - exceptions are on the peninsula of Baja California and places like Puerto Pe&ntilde;asco where it runs to the ocean front along the main highways.)</p>
                    <p><strong>NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED A VEHICLE IMPORT PERMIT FOR DRIVING YOUR RV IN ANY PART OF THE BAJA PENNINSULA OR THE SONORA FREE ZONE (In Sonora, you are only required to obtain a permit if driving further than kilometer 98 of Mexican Federal Highway No. 15.)</strong></p>

                    <h2>** 2016 Update for RVs &amp; Motorhomes **</h2>
                    <p>Many of our customers have raised concerns about possibly new regulations reguarding the importation of RVs. Our Mexpro Angel, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/meet-mexpro.html" title="Meet Mexpro">Angelica Terrazas</a>, spoke to Banjercito and below is the information she obtained.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The maximum weight for all vehicles, including motor homes, in order to obtain a temporary import permit at Banjercito is 7,716 pounds, which is equal to 3.8 tons.</li>

                    <li>Temporary import permits for motor homes can be issued for up to 10 years but they have to be registered as a motorhome in order to qualify for this permit.</li>

                    <li>Vehicles that exceed the specified weight, need to go to <a href="https://www.aduana.cl/aduana/site/edic/base/port/inicio.html" title="Aduanas" target="_blank">Aduanas</a> (at the border) for an inspection. There it will be determined if the vehicle is in good working condition and meets all the general requirements for temporary importation.</li>

                    <li>If the vehicle is towing another car, the attached unit would also undergo the inspection. Also, people who are towing need to make sure they disclose this when applying for the import permits.
                    <ol type="a"><li>If the motorhome is towing another vehicle, the time limit for the temporary import permit is a maximum of 180 days.</li></ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>There could be a difference in the price for vehicles that undergo the extra inspection, than vehicles that only go through Banjercito. According to our sources at Banjercito, Aduanas would determine the cost.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If the vehicle is not returned to the US prior to the expiration date on the permit, or the permit is not canceled upon exiting Mexico, the guarantee deposit will be forfeited.</p>
                    <p>Before Banjercito issues a permit, they will verify the VIN # to make sure the vehicle does not have any restrictions to be driven in the US or Canada, in which case the permit will not be allowed.</p>
                    <p>It is important that we remind our customers to cancel the permit at the border prior to returning to the US, to ensure that they receive their guarantee deposit back.</p>
                    <p>As long as the customers have enough time (between 7-10 days), it is recommended that they process the temporary importation permit online. This will improve their experience and avoid the time spent at the border crossing.</p>
                    <p>Accepted credit cards for securing the deposit are MasterCard, Visa and American Express. Your card will be imprinted by a Mexican official but the deposit amount will not be charged to your card unless the vehicle is not returned to Banjercito upon the completion of your trip for permit cancellation.</p>

                    <h2 title="Multiple Entries Mexico">Multiple Entries with your Vehicle Import Permit</h2>
                    <p>Once you have a vehicle import permit you may drive your vehicle across the border multiple times during the valid length of your permit.</p>

                    <h2 title="Cancel Permit">CANCELING THE PERMIT UPON EXITING MEXICO</h2>
                    <p>You do not have to exit Mexico from the same port as you entered to cancel your permit. Your temporary vehicle import permit can be cancelled at any Banjercito location along the border. <strong>You MUST CANCEL YOUR VEHICLE IMPORT PERMIT UPON YOUR FINAL RE-ENTRY INTO THE US.</strong> If you do not, you may not be allowed to drive into Mexico again without the permit.</p>

                    <h2 title="Others Persons Driving">Other persons driving your RV in Mexico</h2>
                    <p>If the documentation shows the vehicle is registered in the name of a spouse, the importation can be done as long as the marriage certificate (and a copy) is presented.</p>
                    <p>A vehicle temporarily imported by the owner may be driven in Mexico by a spouse or adult children, as long as they have the same immigration status. Other persons may drive the vehicle as long as the owner is in the vehicle. </p>

                    <h2 title="Warning">Warning</h2>
                    <p>Travelers should avoid individuals outside vehicle permit offices offering to obtain the permits without waiting in line, even if they appear to be government officials. There have been reports of fraudulent or counterfeit permits being issued adjacent to the vehicle import permit office in Nuevo Laredo and other border areas. If the proper permit is not obtained before entering Mexico and cannot be obtained at the Banjercito branch at the port of entry, do not proceed to the interior. Travelers without the proper permit may be incarcerated, fined and/or have their vehicle seized at immigration/customs checkpoints.</p>
