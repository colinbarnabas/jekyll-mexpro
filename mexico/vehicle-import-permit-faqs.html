                            <p>Any time you drive a vehicle beyond the Mexico <a href="https://www.mexpro.com/blog/mexico-hassle-free-vehicle-zone" title="Mexico Free Zone"><em>Free Zone</em></a>, you will need to purchase a Mexico Vehicle Import Permit. The Mexico Free Zone is also known as the Liberated Zone, or Perimeter Zone or Free Trade Zone. The term is a customs designation for the area located along the Mexican international land borders, and which run inward up to the point at which the Mexican Customs authorities have their first "interior check point.” This is usually about 20 to 26 kilometers or 12-17 miles from the border towns. Exceptions are on the peninsula of Baja California and places like Puerto Peñasco and other portions of Sonora, though not all of Sonora.</p>
