                    <h1>How to Cancel an In Effect Mexico Auto Insurance Policy</h1>
                        <h2>Already In Effect</h2>
                        <p>If you need to <strong>cancel</strong> your Mexican Car insurance policy, Mexpro will need your request in writing. We <strong>cannot</strong> cancel any policy via a phone call or voicemail. The date the policy became effective will play an important role in how to proceed. Please include your policy number, your name (as it appears on the policy), and your reason for cancellation.</p>
                        <p>The rules governing cancellations of Mexpro's car insurance policies were disclosed before you purchased, and are printed in your policy documents:</p>
                            <p>All cancellations can be done by using our <a href="https://help.mexpro.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=78967">online cancellation form</a>. Policies cancelled before the date the insurance coverage begins, will receive a full refund minus the policy fee. Policies cancelled after the date the insurance coverage begins, will receive a pro-rated refund.  Does not apply to daily policies, there are no cancellations or refunds on daily policies.  Our 6 month and Annual policies carry a high discount and are fully earned after 20 days on a 6 month policy and 30 days on an Annual policy.</p>
                            <h3>Mexico Auto Policies Shorter than 6-Months</h3>
                                <p>If your Mexico Auto Insurance policy is already in effect, we will require a Notarized cancellation request that states your insured vehicle did not enter Mexico. If your vehicle did enter Mexico, then unfortunately we will not be able to cancel the policy as it is no longer eligible. The notarized request can be mailed (214 East Birch Avenue, Flagstaff, AZ 86001), emailed (<a href="mailto:mexico@mexpro.com">Mexico@Mexpro.com</a>), or faxed (928-779-7221).</p>
                            <h3>6-Month and Annual Policies</h3>
                                <p>If your policy is already in effect, we will need to know if your vehicle has already entered Mexico. If it has, and your policy has not been in effect for longer than 20 days for a 6 month policy or 30 days for an annual policy, we will be able to cancel the policy simply by charging you for the days you have used at the daily policy rate. If your vehicle has been in Mexico past 20 days for a 6 month policy or 30 days for an annual policy, the policy is no longer eligible for cancellation.</p>
                                <p>If your vehicle has not gone into Mexico, then we will need to have a Notarized cancellation request. Please send to 214 East Birch Avenue, Flagstaff, AZ 86001, or email (<a href="mailto:mexico@mexpro.com">Mexico@Mexpro.com</a>), or fax (928-779-7221).</p>
                        <p>Once we receive your request, we will process it within 24 business hours. A cancellation fee will be charged, and you will be <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/customer-service/refunds.html" title="refunds">refunded</a> the remaining premium. This fee will be equal to half of the agency fee listed on your policy. We will contact you once this has been completed if you have provided contact information to us.</p>
                        <p>If you are cancelling a policy in order to replace it with another policy, please include the new policy number in your request to cancel the first policy. We will refund you 100% of the policy funds and not charge a cancellation fee.</p>
                        <p>Our hours of operation are 7 a.m. – 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, and Saturday 7 a.m. – 4 p.m. Arizona Mountain Standard Time MST (year round).
