                            <p>Mexican auto insurance is different from US auto coverage, but that doesn't mean you can't get great insurance coverage for your car while you are in Mexico. To ensure you get the best coverage at the best price we represent multiple companies, which have three programs each: Basic, Standard and Extended coverage options.</p>
