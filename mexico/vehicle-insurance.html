                        <p>Mexpro is a leader in the Mexican auto insurance market, providing Mexico car insurance since 1999 for United States and Canadian citizens who are either Mexican residents or tourists. If you plan on crossing the US border and driving your vehicle into Mexico, you must have Mexican domiciled Car Insurance. United States and Canadian insurance policies are invalid in Mexico. Having Mexican insurance is the only safe way to protect against collision, theft, liability, and loss of vehicle to the Mexican authorities in case of an accident or other possible complications due to a lack of Mexican car insurance.</p>
                        <p>There are less than 20 insurance companies in all of Mexico who offer Tourist Mexican auto insurance coverage. When buying your coverage from Mexico Insurers, it is important that you check the specific A.M. Best rating for that insurer. Mexpro represents the finest in Mexico insurance with outstanding A.M. Best rating. Some large Mexico Insurance Providers, or their parent company (if any) have not been rated by the A.M. Best Company. You should never buy your coverage from unrated insurers in the US-let alone Mexico! Each insurance company we insure your vehicle with in Mexico, or their parent company, carries an &quot;Excellent&quot; or &quot;Good&quot; rating from A.M. Best. <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/pdf/AMIS-2016-Tourist-Auto-Mexpro-May-2017.pdf" title="Mexico Insurance Rankings">See the 2016 Mexico Tourist Auto Insurer Rankings</a>.</p>
