                        <p>In the late 1990’s, owners, Jim and Andrea Labelle, envisioned an insurance company that would offer top quality Mexico auto insurance online, a product unavailable at that time. Now for nearly 20 years, Mexpro has been doing just that.</p>
                        <blockquote>We started in our basement back in 1999!</blockquote>
                        <p> - <em>Jim Labelle, Mexpro Mexico Insurance Professionals CEO</em>.</p>
                        <p>Before Mexpro’s inception, Mexico insurance had mostly been purchased at the US border, from insurers who may or may not have been financially stable. With a long history in the insurance industry, Jim Labelle felt it important to offer insurance from quality, A-rated insurers.
                        <p>Many Mexican insurers were not and are not rated by A.M. Best, a company that grades various businesses on financial stability and customer service. This means the ability to pay claims.</p>
                        <p>In addition, there was little guarantee that agents who sold insurance near the border would even turn in a policy to the insurer, unless there was a claim. If you had an accident and you called your insurer you may, or may not have a policy issued.</p>
                        <p>Customer service and claims for Mexican insurance was (and is) generally served by Spanish speakers. The Labelle’s idea was to offer services in English to Americans and Canadians.</p>
                        <p>With these top priorities in mind Jim and Andrea Labelle began working with top Mexico insurers to develop programs to meet these conditions. Long hours were spent traveling and creating this specialty insurance, as well as in developing English speaking claims and service departments for Americans and Canadians who drive to Mexico. And from there came Mexpro.</p>
                        <p>Since 1999 Mexpro has become the leading provider of Mexico Car Insurance because we provide a very high standard of care to our customers. Today we offer more than just auto insurance in Mexico. Other Mexico products include motorcycle insurance, RV and travel trailer insurance, home and condo insurance, watercraft insurance and travel health insurance. We are continually striving to improve the services we provide.</p>
