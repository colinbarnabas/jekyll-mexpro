                    <h1>Temporary Vehicle Importation Permit for Mexico</h1>
                    <p><strong>*Please note:</strong> A Temporary Importation Permit (TIP) can <strong>ONLY</strong> be obtained through Mexico's <a href="https://www.mexpro.com/blog/banjercito-need-know" title="Who is Banjercito">Banjercito</a> government agency. Mexpro has no affiliation, authority or connections with this organization.</p>
                    <p><img class="img-rt img-responsive img-rounded" src="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/images/border-tijuana.png" width="350" height="230" alt="Tijuana Border">If you plan to drive a vehicle beyond the Mexico &quot;<a href="https://www.mexpro.com/blog/mexico-free-border-zone" title="Mexico Free Zone">Free Zone</a>&quot; you will need to purchase a Mexico Vehicle Import Permit. The temporary vehicle import permit can be obtained from Banjercito, the official Mexican issuing agency. It is valid for any type of vehicle, weighing less than three tons, for up to six months (180 days). The permit may be purchased online at the <a href="https://www.banjercito.com.mx/registroVehiculos/" title="Banjercito" target="_blank">Banjercito website</a> or at the Mexican border. One can purchase the permit online 7-60 days prior to travel into Mexico.</p>
                    <p>Simply put, the Mexico Free Zone refers to all of the Mexican state of Baja and portions of Sonora. Also called the Hassle Free Zone, Liberated Zone, Perimeter Zone or Free Trade Zone, the term is a "customs designation only for that area located along the Mexican international land borders and which run inward up to the point at which the Mexican Customs authorities have their first 'interior' check point." This is usually about 20 to 26 kilometers in from the border towns - exceptions are on the peninsula of Baja California and places like Puerto Peñasco where it runs to the ocean front along the main highways.</p>
                    <p><strong>You do NOT need a Temporary Vehicle Import Permit for driving in any part of the Baja Peninsula or the Sonoran Free Zone. In Sonora, you are only required to obtain a permit if driving further than kilometer 98 of Mexican Federal Highway No. 15.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>You can obtain a <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/sonora-vehicle-import-permit.html" title="Vehicle Import Permit for Sonora">&quot;Sonora ONLY&quot; Vehicle Import Permit</a> if you only plan to travel in the Mexican State of Sonora.</strong></p>
                    <p>Despite any advice, official or unofficial, vehicle permits cannot be obtained at checkpoints in the interior of Mexico.</p>

                    <p>If the documentation shows the vehicle is registered in the name of a spouse, the importation can be done as long as the marriage certificate (and a copy) is presented.</p>
                    <p>A vehicle temporarily imported by the owner may be driven in Mexico by a spouse or adult children, as long as they have the same immigration status. Other persons may drive the vehicle as long as the owner is in the vehicle.</p>

                    <h2 title="Warning">Warning</h2>
                    <p>Travelers should avoid individuals outside vehicle permit offices offering to obtain the permits without waiting in line, even if they appear to be government officials. There have been reports of fraudulent or counterfeit permits being issued adjacent to the vehicle import permit offices in border areas. If the proper permit is not obtained before entering Mexico and cannot be obtained at the Banjercito branch at the port of entry, do not proceed to the interior. Travelers without the proper permit may be incarcerated, fined and/or have their vehicle seized at immigration/customs checkpoints.</p>
