                        <h2 title="Speed Limits">2. Mexico Speed Limits</h2>
                            <p>Speed limits are posted in Kilometers per hour, not miles per hour, so when you see that sign on the side of the road that says 90, it does not mean that you should drive 90 miles per hour. The posted speed limits in Mexico are generally a little slower than what you might be used to seeing on the US highways. Along the way, you may encounter some other drivers moving along at what seems to be an excruciatingly slow pace, and you'll have to try to carefully pass them. You also most likely will see some drivers exceeding the posted speed limits by a lot, and although you may be tempted, we would not recommend that you follow their example. You may want to keep your speed within the posted limits, so you'll spend more time vacationing, instead of talking to the Policia Federal (Federal Police). Most speedometers will have an additional row of numbers, besides the miles per hour increments, to indicate your vehicle's speed in kilometers per hour, but just in case, we have included a handy kilometers per hour to miles per hour conversion chart below: </p>

                            <p>Be extremely careful when passing other vehicles in Mexico, because drivers there will sometimes use their turn signals a little differently than we are used to seeing in the US You may see a driver put on their right hand turn signal as they are pulling onto the right hand shoulder of the road, which normally would mean they are making a right turn. However, in Mexico, it is not uncommon for drivers to pull onto the shoulder, wait for an opening in traffic, and then make a sweeping left hand turn across all of the lanes.</p>
                            <p>Another Mexico turn signal anomaly that you may experience will be a slower driver pulling onto the right hand shoulder with their left hand turn signal on, which is their way of indicating that they are allowing faster vehicles behind them to pass. Bottom line, a left turn signal does not always mean that a left hand turn is about to be made, nor does a right turn signal always mean the driver is going to turn to the right, so it is best to always proceed with extra caution whenever passing any vehicles in Mexico.</p>
