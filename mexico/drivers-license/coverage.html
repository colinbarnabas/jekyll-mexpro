How can that be? Well it all depends on how you look at it, and what you are trying to do.</p>
    
                    <p>Mexpro writes Driver's license polices through Grupo Nacional Provincial. Let's look at the coverage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Liability Options Include:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>$50,000</p></li>
                        <li><p>$100,000</p></li>
                        <li><p>$300,000</p></li>
                        <li><p>$500,000</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Legal Assistance:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>$20,000</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="col-xs-12 hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg">
                        <a href="https://sb.iigins.com/quote/?aff_id=2149&amp;agtdst=drivliccov" title="Get Quote"><span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/images/drivers-license-thumbs-up.png" width="300" height="226" class="img-responsive img-rounded center" alt="Drivers License Thumbs Up" itemprop="contentURL"></span></a>

                    <p>That's it, that's all you get with a driver's license policy; no medical payments, no travel assistance and NO PHYSICAL DAMAGE coverage. <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/coverage/liability-insurance.html" title="Liability Insurance">Liability</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/coverage/legal-assistance.html" title="Legal Assistance Coverage">Legal Assistance</a> are all that is offered. Now, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/mexvisit.html" title="MexVisit Auto Insurance Supplement">MexVisit travel assistance</a> can be purchased with a driver's license policy to provide travel assistance, but the policy itself does not provide that coverage.</p>
                    <p>With such limited coverage why would one purchase such a policy? There are two reasons:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>You have multiple vehicles that you intend to drive in Mexico, AND the condition or value of the vehicles do not justify insuring them for physical damage. Remember these policies provide NO PHYSICAL DAMAGE COVERAGE.</p></li>
                        <li><p>You have registered street legal motorcycles, ATVs, quads, and golf carts that are ineligible for other types of coverage. The <em>key here is registered and street legal</em>, but yes these policies can cover some of the odd types of vehicles that other carriers won't take. </p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>How is the price determined? By the limit of liability you choose AND the number of drivers. The more drivers, the more risk, and the more it costs. Regardless of what you purchase these policies are pretty affordable, but they are not for every situation. Again, if you would insure the vehicle for Physical Damage here in the US, then this is not the policy for you. But if you have liability only coverage on your vehicle in the US or can't qualify for other coverage, then a driver's license may work out. </p>
                    <p><strong>A couple of final thoughts on Mexico Driver's license auto insurance policies.</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>You can buy <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/coverage/physical-damage.html" title="Physical Damage Insurance Coverage">physical damage</a> for most cars, SUVs, Trucks, and Vans if you have them covered for collision and theft in the US.</p></li>
                        <li><p>If you are concerned about the lack of medical payments on a driver's license policy, you can purchase an <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/international-health/" title="Travel Health Insurance">International Travel Health insurance</a> policy, also offered by Mexpro.</p></li>
                        <li><p>If you want travel assistance coverage you can add <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/mexvisit.html" title="MexVisit Travel Assistance">Mexvisit travel assist</a> to your policy.</p></li>
                    </ol>
