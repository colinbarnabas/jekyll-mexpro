                <h1>Mexico Auto Insurance Medical Payments Coverage</h1>
                <p>Purchasing an appropriate amount of Mexico tourist <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/coverage/liability-insurance.html" title="Auto Liability coverage">auto liability insurance</a> (a <a href="https://www.mexpro.com/blog/mexico-insurance-alert-radical-change-to-mexico-liability-laws" title="Liability Insurance Limits for Mexico">$300,000 or greater limit is recommended</a>) can not only give you peace of mind, but also provides the critical coverage needed in case your vehicle is involved in an at-fault accident that results in bodily injuries, death or property damage outside of the insured vehicle.</p>
                <p>What about getting coverage for injuries sustained by the passengers or the driver inside the insured vehicle? On a Mexico auto insurance policy, you'll want to carefully consider the amount offered for <strong>Medical Payments</strong> coverage, as this coverage takes care of the occupants of your vehicle that sustain bodily injury in a covered accident.</p>
                <p>In the United States, when the Medical Payments limit of coverage gets exhausted, the limit of coverage for liability is sometimes used for the additional medical expenses of the people inside the insured vehicle. However, on a Mexico tourist auto insurance policy, the liability coverage specifically excludes the passengers and driver of the insured vehicle. This is because Mexican tort law does not recognize passenger liability in personal passenger autos, like they do in livery vehicles. Without any additional help from the liability coverage, the Medical Payments coverage limit will be the most that the insurance company will pay for the medical treatment expenses of the people inside the insured vehicle.</p>
                <p>There are some important things that you will probably want to consider when choosing a Mexican auto insurance policy. First of all, does the insurer offer Medical Payments limits that would provide sufficient coverage if the driver and/or passengers in your vehicle were to sustain injuries that might require hospitalization or possibly extended rehabilitation? Do you already carry an existing health or medical insurance policy that would cover your medical expenses if you were involved in an automobile accident in Mexico? If not, then you'll probably want to consider purchasing a policy that includes the highest limit available for Medical Payments and/or purchase a supplementary health insurance policy.</p>
                <p>Our '<em>A-rated</em>' Mexico auto insurers offer Medical Payments coverage limits in amounts ranging from as little as $2,000 per person / $10,000 per accident and up to $15,000 per person / $75,000 per accident. We offer standard coverage packages as a more affordable option for those who are more price-conscious. And, for those who prefer the best possible coverage option, we offer extended packages. Our extended policies will always offer a higher limit of coverage for medical payments than the standard coverage plans for the same insurer. </p>
                <p><strong>Motorcycle policies do NOT include Medical Payments coverage for any driver or passengers.</strong></p>
