                <p>Purchasing the standard Mexico auto insurance policy package is an economical way to cover your vehicle in Mexico. While it does not afford the same coverage as the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/coverage/extended.html" title="Extended Coverage Policy">extended policy</a>, it does provide the basics, and can be accepted by finance companies with the proper coverage. However, each standard package is a little different in the coverage it provides. To ensure you purchase the correct coverage you need, we have provided a comparison of each program side-by-side below.<p>

                <p>One of the benefits of the standard Mexico insurance policy is its flexibility. For example, when it comes to the deductible, you can purchase a percentage deductible that keeps your premium low, but requires a higher out of pocket cost in the event of an accident. Or, you can purchase a <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/coverage/deductibles.html" title="Deductibles">fixed deductible</a> that increases your premium, but requires a lower out of pocket cost in the event of an accident.</p>
                <p>Another example is liability limits, while the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/coverage/extended.html" title="Extended Package">extended package</a> automatically comes with $300,000 CSL for liability, the standard policy allows you to purchase lower limits. It is important to understand that <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/auto/new-2014-insurance-law/three-new.html" title="Laws in Mexico">the laws in Mexico have changed</a> and Mexpro recommends no lower than $300,000 CSL in liability, and strongly encourages  you to consider the $500,000 option.</p>
