                <p>When you purchase Extended Coverage (Broadening Endorsement) as part of your Mexico insurance policy with ABA or El Aguila, the coverage includes 'Modified GAP' coverage.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, many borrowers owe more to the lender at the time of a total loss than the vehicle is worth. In the past some insureds have had to <em>come out of pocket</em> to make up the difference between the Actual Cash Value ACV (which is paid by the insurer) and the balance of the loan.</p>
                <p>As long as you properly insure your vehicle with us for the current <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/coverage/vehicle-value.html">Actual Cash Value</a>, then if you owe more than the value to your lender at the time of a total loss, our GAP coverage will apply and the insurer will pay up to 15% more than the ACV/Current Market Value of your vehicle to the lender--to make up the 'GAP'.</p>
                <p>Another reason to choose the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/coverage/aba-seguros-extended.html">ABA</a> or <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/coverage/el-aguila-extended.html">El Aguila</a> Extended Coverage programs!</p>
