                      <p>Mexican Motorcycle insurance can be hard to get as not many Mexico insurance companies offer physical damage coverage for motorcycles in Mexico. While liability coverage is available from many companies, and is important, insuring the bike against collision and theft are what most riders are after.</p>
                      <p>At Mexpro.com we offer three companies that will provide Mexican Motorcycle insurance coverage that includes liability and physical damage. Not only do ACE Seguros, ABA Seguros, and El Aguila make their standard coverage available for motorcycles, they also make their extended coverage package available. Extended packages includes coverage for partial theft and vandalism, as well as US repairs. There is a caveat, these policies do not cover <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/coverage/medical-payments.html">medical payments</a>, so you will want to pick up a <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/international-health/">travel health policy</a>. When it comes to motorcycles we take care of our customers. After all, three of us here at Mexpro prefer two wheels to four (<a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/meet-mexpro.html" title="Mexpro Team of Motorcycle Riders">Angel loves her Harley, Jack prefers the speed of his Hayabusa, and Mike Rides his Honda Valkyrie</a>.)</p>
