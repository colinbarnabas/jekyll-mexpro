                    <p><a href="https://www.mexpro.com/en-US/quotes/new/#/" title="Car Insurance Quote"><span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/images/boat-sunset.png" width="300" height="200" class="img-responsive img-rounded img-rt" alt="Boat Sunset" itemprop="contentURL"></span></a>If you plan on towing something in Mexico, the first question to ask yourself is &quot;Do I want physical damage and theft coverage on the towed unit while it's in tow ONLY, or also while it is <em>self-propelled</em> (not coupled to the towing unit)?&quot;</P>
                    <p>Please see the scenarios below to determine how to cover your towables:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>If you do <strong>NOT</strong> want physical damage nor theft coverage on towables at any time (neither while in tow, nor while self-propelled or decoupled from the towing unit), you do not need to list your towed units on the Mexpro quote form. Liability only coverage applies to any towed unit while being towed, whether listed on the policy or not.</p></li>
                        <li><p>If you want Physical Damage and Theft coverage on the towables, <strong>only when they are in tow</strong>, list them on the policy with a corresponding <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/coverage/vehicle-value.html">Actual Cash Value</a>.</p></li>
                        <li><p>If you want Physical Damage and Theft coverage on the towables, <strong>both while in tow, and also when decoupled and/or self-propelled</strong>, follow the instructions below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><strong>Travel Trailers, Fifth Wheels, Toy Haulers, Boat Trailers, Tent Trailers, and Utility Trailers:</strong></p>
                            <p>List them as a towed unit on the primary vehicle policy with a corresponding value to secure coverage while in tow and while decoupled.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Boats and Jet Skis:</strong></p><p>List them as a towed unit on the primary vehicle policy with a corresponding value and they will be covered while in tow only. Mexpro's <a href="https://www.mexpro.com/mexico-wc/quote/?aff_id=2149&amp;lang=en&amp;agtdst=towunit">Mexico Watercraft Liability insurance</a> will protect you from third party claims while on the water. Physical damage/hull coverage for watercraft, once disconnected from the towing unit, is not provided.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Companion Autos, SUVs, Trucks, Vans:</strong></p><p>You will want to obtain a separate policy insuring these self-propelled units for either Liability Only or Physical Damage. The coverage you choose (Liability only or Physical Damage) will apply both while in tow and while self-propelled.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Motorcycles/ATVs/Golf Carts/Utility Vehicles:</strong></p><p>Obtain a separate Liability Only or Physical Damage policy and it will cover the vehicle(s) both while in tow and while self-propelled. The deductible for ATV’s and UTV’s is $2,000 while decoupled from the towing unit.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The couch, ice chest, or canoe doesn't necessarily need to be listed. But if a unit can be pulled or moved on its own (self-propelled), and you want liability only OR physical damage and theft coverage while in operation, you need to buy a separate policy.</p>
                    <p>If you need coverage for towed units on a Mexico insurance policy, obtaining your quote will be much easier if you get all the unit paperwork together before you start the process.</p>
