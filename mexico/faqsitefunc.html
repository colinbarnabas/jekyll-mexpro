                                <strong>Q: If I have a question while getting my quote or completing my Mexico Insurance application, is there someplace online where I can get answers? </strong>

                                <p><strong>A: Yes!</strong> Throughout the process of getting a quote or completing a Mexico insurance application there are a number of &quot;help&quot; options. Just look for a question mark button (?) or &quot;More Info...&quot; text. These typically will be to the right of the field in the application or, in the case of the quote results page, the &quot;More Info...&quot; text will appear under the &quot;Buy Now&quot; button.</p>
                                <p itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ContactPoint">When you click on these buttons a new window will open with an explanation of the coverage OR it will explain what we mean by this field. Of course if our &quot;help&quot; buttons don't help, call us toll free at <a class="hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg" href="tel:+18887234617" rel="nofollow" title="Llama a Mexpro"><span itemprop="telephone" contactType="customer support" areaServed="US, CA, MX" ContactOption="TollFree" availableLanguage="English, Spanish">+1-888-723-4617</span></a><span class="hidden-xs"><span itemprop="telephone" contactType="customer support" areaServed="US, CA, MX" ContactOption="TollFree" availableLanguage="English, Spanish">+1-888-723-4617</span></span>.

                                <strong>Q: How do we list two drivers on a Mexico car insurance policy?</strong>
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p><strong>A: </strong>It is not necessary that every driver of the vehicle be listed on a Mexico Car insurance policy. It is only necessary that the primary driver be listed. This is because Mexico car insurance is a permissive use policy. This means that as long as the driver of the vehicle has permission of the owner, and is of the &quot;same risk profile&quot; they will be covered. </p>
                                <p>By &quot;same risk profile&quot; we mean that unless in the quote application the insured identifies that there would be a driver under the age of 21, that the driver be older than 21. Also, it means that the driver have a valid non-Mexico Driver's license.</p>
                                <p>That said, there are some situations when the lienholder will require that the two drivers be listed on the policy. In this case there is a field in the application where additional drivers can be added. If a company needs to be listed, then it too can be listed.</p>

                                <strong>Q: What happens if I will be driving a car that I do not own (meaning it is borrowed, leased, or financed)? Can I insure it?</strong>
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p><strong>A: </strong>If you will be driving a vehicle in Mexico that you do not own, the process for ensuring you don't run into any trouble is relatively simple. All you need is a notarized letter of permission from the owner of the vehicle. This rule applies to borrowed, leased or financed vehicles. </p>
                                <p>One word of caution, specifically on leased and financed vehicles;  be sure you understand any requirements they may have for insuring a vehicle in Mexico. For example, Ally Financial (formerly GMAC) has long required $100,000 in Liability and Fixed deductibles, as have many other finance companies. Failure to meet these requirements can cause a delay in getting the letter of permission and may require the cancellation of your policy and the purchase of a new Mexico Insurance policy. </p>

                                <strong>Q: I am having trouble printing my policy and/or didn't receive a confirmation email. How do I get my policy? </strong>

                                <p><strong>A: </strong>Once you have purchased a Mexico insurance policy, you have four ways of getting your policy. In three of the four methods you will need a PDF reader installed on your computer.  This is free software, <a href="//get2.adobe.com/reader/" title="Download Adobe Reader" target="_blank">download Adobe Reader here [https://get2.adobe.com/reader/]</a>. </p>
                                <p>The &quot;policy&quot; documents are made up of two pieces: the &quot;policy&quot; and the &quot;terms and conditions.&quot; The Policy consists of several documents, includes a receipt, a declarations page in English, a declarations page in Spanish, a statutory disclosure regarding coverage, and claims instructions in English and Spanish. If you purchased the MexVisit travel assistance coverage you will also have a declarations page and claims instructions included that are specifically for MexVisit. If you purchased the Extended Endorsements to supplement the standard Mexico Car Insurance policy, you will also have that Endorsement. The terms and conditions are the legal &quot;<em>fine print</em>&quot; that spells out what is covered and what is not. </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>You will have the ability to immediately access and print the policy and terms and conditions of your policy. Simply click on &quot;print policy&quot;, and the system will open your policy in a PDF and you can save and print your policy. Pretty simple.<br><br></li>
                                    <li>We will send you an email with links that allow you to open up a page that you can use to access the policy and the terms and conditions.<br><br></li>
                                    <li>Upon issuance you will be assigned and sent an email with a Username and Password that allows you to log in to our customer menu, where you can see quotes and policies that you have created in our system. By clicking on a policy you can access the policy documents and print them. Also from this menu you can cancel or void your policy, or issue a new policy using the information from an old policy.<br><br></li>
                                    <li>Finally, you can actually Fax the policy to yourself or another entity (like a finance company or bank) directly from our systems. Simply input the fax number and hit send, our servers will do the rest.<br></li>

This can be emailed to <a href="mailto:mexico@mexpro.com" title="Email Mexpro">Mexpro@Mexpro.com</a> or you can fax us at 928-779-7221.

                                <strong>Q: How do I renew a policy?</strong>
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p><strong>A: Mexico Insurance policies do not renew</strong> in a traditional sense, or at least not in the sense that we know it here in the US, since every policy that is issued is a <em>New</em> policy without any connection to previous policies. However, we at Mexpro have made the process of purchasing a new policy easy, and allow you to issue a new Mexpro insurance policy using old information.  This means you simply have to open up an old policy, update the dates of coverage, anything that has changed, and new payment information, and you are off and running in minutes. </p>
                                <p itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ContactPoint">There are two ways to purchase a new policy. The first is to log in using our customer menu. From there you will be able to access all quotes, and policies associated with your account. By clicking on the policy you wish to renew you will be able to follow the process as described above. To further assist you, we will send you an email 2-4 weeks before your policy expires (or 2 to 4 weeks before you last purchased a policy). That email has a one-time log in that allows you to issue a new policy in minutes.

The password should have been emailed to you upon the purchase of your policy. However, if you do not know your username or password you can simply click on our password retrieval button.  You will be asked to input your email address, and hit submit. You will then be sent an email that will identity your Username, and provide a link that you can use to reset your password.  Once you have reset the password you will be logged in to the client menu, and able to access your quotes and policies.</p>
