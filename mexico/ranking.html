                        <p>Unfortunately, many purchasers of insurance for Mexico are misled by believing that they can rely on the broker, rather than the Mexican Insurance Company, to properly handle their claim in Mexico. The truth is, the company you purchase insurance for Mexico from should be much more important to you than the Broker that sells you the policy. Although you will want to make sure that the broker is properly licensed, and has the customer service facility needed to properly take care of your needs, it is the Mexican Insurance Company that ultimately pays the claim.</p>
                        <p>As the global economic environment continues in a state of uncertainty, it may be more important than ever to purchase insurance for Mexico from a financially strong insurer. No matter how reputable your agent or broker, if they are placing your insurance with a troubled insurer you could be in for some unpleasant surprises in the event of a claim. There are over 50 Mexican Insurance Companies in Mexico; similar to the US, &quot;some are good and some are bad.&quot; Please check out the Mexico tourist auto statistics using the links above to protect yourself and your invesment.</p>
                        <p>Although some US insurers have purchased ownership interest in Mexican Insurance Companies, these companies operate independently of the US parent company. Ask your agent about the size and financial strength of the Mexican Insurance companies they use; in the event of further economic problems and/or the devaluation of the Peso, coupled with a few natural disasters such as a hurricane or flood, how will the insurer fare?</p>
