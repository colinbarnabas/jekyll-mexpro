                        <p>There are less than 20 insurance companies in all of Mexico who offer Tourist Auto insurance coverage. When buying your coverage from Mexico Insurers, it is important that you check the specific A.M. Best rating for that insurer. Some large Mexico Car Insurance Providers, or their parent companies (if any) have not been rated by A.M. Best Company. You should never buy your coverage from unrated insurers in the US--let alone Mexico!
