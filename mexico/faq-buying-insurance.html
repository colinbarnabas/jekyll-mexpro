                            <strong>Q: Does my US Auto insurance cover me in Mexico?</strong>
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p><strong>A: NO!</strong> Some people believe that their US auto policy will cover them in Mexico; however, the in most cases it will not or the coverage will be vastly inferior.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p>US auto policies have a defined territory. In most cases this includes the US, Canada, and US territories such as Puerto Rico. Because Mexico is not listed there is no coverage under a US policy.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Some believe they can purchase an endorsement or <em>add on</em> to their policy that will provide coverage in Mexico. While these endorsements do exist, there is usually language in the endorsement that says something along the lines of the following:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>&quot;Auto Accidents in Mexico are Subject to the Laws of Mexico, Not the laws of the United States. Under Mexican law, Auto Accidents are considered a criminal offense as well as a civil Matter.&quot;* In other words, insurance is designed to meet the laws of a state or country and US insurance coverage does not meet the requirements of Mexican law or insurance requirements.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>&quot;The coverage we provide you by this endorsement does not meet Mexican auto insurance requirements.&quot;* In other words, insurance is designed to meet the laws of a state or country and US insurance coverage does not meet the requirements of Mexican law or insurance requirements.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>&quot;You are required to purchase liability insurance through a licensed Mexican insurance company for this endorsement to apply.&quot;* In other words there is no real coverage provided, get it elsewhere.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>The coverage is usually limited to 25-75 Miles from the border.</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The bottom line is that the US policy will not meet your needs, won't be recognized by the authorities, and you need to purchase as separate policy.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ContactPoint">If you have an RV, then there is a way to purchase coverage for physical damage on a US policy with a separate policy that will save you a ton of money, but there are some important things to understand so give us a call today for more information at <strong><a class="hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg" href="tel:+18887234617" rel="nofollow" title="Llama a Mexpro"><span itemprop="telephone" contactType="customer support" areaServed="US, CA, MX" ContactOption="TollFree" availableLanguage="English, Spanish">+1-888-723-4617</span></a><span class="hidden-xs"><span itemprop="telephone" contactType="customer support" areaServed="US, CA, MX" ContactOption="TollFree" availableLanguage="English, Spanish">+1-888-723-4617</span></span></strong>.</p></li>
