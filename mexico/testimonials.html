                        <p>&quot;<em>I just wanted to drop you a line to say thank-you. We purchased insurance from you for a recent Mexico trip, and included the Mex-Visit travel assist. When our car broke down on Highway 57 south, about 50km north of San Luis Potosi, I called the 800 number and was assisted by a very helpful English speaking representative named Eduardo Martinez. Eduardo called a tow truck for us, re-assured us that we were being helped, and gave me his return extension so that we could contact him if we needed to. The tow-truck came in about an hour, and the driver took us to a great mechanic who fixed the problem immediately, at a very reasonable price. Less than four hours after breaking down, we were back on the road and continued safely to our destination. I don't know what we would have done without your assistance. Thank-you, and please forward my thanks to Eduardo.  He took care of everything in a calm, professional manner and was very reassuring at a time when I was nervous about being stranded. Thanks,</em>&quot; Betsy 08-25-2011</p>

                        <p>&quot;<em>I have used a different insurance company to cover my vehicle while I travel to Mexico. My previous insurer could not provide theft coverage due to age of my car.
