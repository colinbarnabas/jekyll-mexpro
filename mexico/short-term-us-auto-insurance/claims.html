                    <p>In Mexico, it is a common procedure for the claims adjuster to be dispatched to the scene of the accident. However, in the U.S this is not the case. All claims must be filed online or over the phone.</p>
                    <p>It is important that you notify the company, of any communication you receive from the other driver, or their insurance company. If you receive a notification of a lawsuit, claim, or any other type of communication, you must inform National Unity or us, your insurance agent. Depending on the seriousness of the incident, National Unity will make decisions as to how to proceed in each case.</p>
