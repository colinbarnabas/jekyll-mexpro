                    <h1>Mexico Motorcycle Insurance Coverage</h1>
                    <p>If you have never gone to Mexico on your bike, then you are missing out. There are a number of well attended rallies and charity events that are worth checking out. That said, some believe it is difficult to get good motorcycle insurance in Mexico. This is not the case with Mexpro. We have three strong programs from <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/mexico/partners.html" title="Our Insurers">our insurers</a>, where you can get great Motorcycle insurance. </p>

                    <p><strong>Legal Assistance:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ABA will provide legal assistance equal to the liability limit</li>
                            <li>Ace Provides $30,000 in legal assistance</li>

                    <p><strong>Medical Payments:</strong></p>
                    <p>EXCLUDED FOR DRIVERS and RIDERS. Clearly this is a problem, but a common one with Mexico Motorcycle insurance policies.

                    <p><strong>Physical Damage:</strong></p>
                    <p>Both ABA and ACE have a Standard and Extended policy available for Motorcycles that are 15-years old or newer. Liability policies are available for bikes that are much older.
