                    <h1>Grupo Nacional Provincial (GNP) Mexico Insurance</h1>
                    <p>Grupo Nacional Provincial (GNP) is one of Mexico largest insurance companies. GNP holds a large market share in six areas: car insurance, home insurance, business insurance, basic insurance, life insurance and medical insurance. GNP is owned by Grupo Bal, a privately held group of Mexican companies. The group was founded in 1901 and is headquartered in Mexico City, Mexico.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Grupo Bal&quot; acquired &quot;La Nacional Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de Seguros&quot; (founded in 1901), and &quot;Seguros la Provincial&quot; (founded in 1936) in December 1992. In the merger the name became &quot;<em>Grupo Nacional Provincial</em>&quot;.</p>
                    <p>This merger has allowed Grupo Nacional Provincial to offer to the public the largest variety of insurance products, including Mexico Tourist Auto Insurance. GNP is committed to a strategy that includes the following points. </p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>The development of a high quality and professional sales force.<br><br></li>
                        <li>The design of products which allow the company to maintain a leading position in all lines of business.<br><br></li>
                        <li>Technological development supported by the most advanced operational systems.<br><br></li>
                        <li>An administrative philosophy resultant from client satisfaction.<br><br></li>
                        <li>Decentralization of its operation with the support of over 40 service offices, 3,000 employees and 4,250 sales agents.
