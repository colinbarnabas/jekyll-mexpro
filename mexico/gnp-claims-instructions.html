                        <h2>WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF CLAIM/ACCIDENT/VEHICLE THEFT</h2>
                        <p><strong>All claims <em>MUST</em> be reported to the toll free number within Mexico.</strong></p>
                        <p>Call this number for Accident, Theft, or Legal Aid, provided by GNP: <strong>01 800 026 5110 </strong></p>
                        <p>This number must be dialed exactly as shown. Please note that you may experience difficulties when dialing from a mobile phone. In addition, the above number is toll free--only if dialed from a private phone. Public phones will charge a local call since only free calls can be made to emergency numbers only.</p>
                        <p>Please note, also, that Grupo Nacional Provincial does not use recordings, all calls are directed to human operators. If you get a recording in Spanish when dialing the above number, it is probable that you made an error or the local Mexican cellular carrier does not provide service to your mobile phone.</p>
                        <p>You <strong>MUST</strong> report all claims prior to leaving Mexico and recrossing the border into the USA. Failure to file a claim prior to leaving Mexico may result in the <strong>DENIAL</strong> of your claim.</p>
